// Here will be going through our control flow statements 
// before moving ahead will just have a look at here meaning that (=) is used to check the
// as will just have a basic look at the operators in the js which are everywhere mostly same 
// < it is called as less than operator
// > it is called as greater than operator
// <= it is called as less than equal to operator
// >= it is called as greater than equal to operator
// = this single equal is operator assignment it is used to assign the value 
// == this double equal operator is used check that is the value is equals to that comapred value eg. 4==4
// === now here comes the triple equal to operator it used to strictly check that if value is striclty equals to the another value
// != this is called as not equal to operator 
// (just a note is there that var kekyword which is there is having the whole scope as global)
// one of it is if-statements.

// console.log(`User power:${power}`)// as we can see overe here that we cannot access the function outside the block scope 
// as like this we can use many if else consditions statements and else-if statements too.
