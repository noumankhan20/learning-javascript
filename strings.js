const name ="Nouman";
const greeting="Hello";
console.log(greeting+name + "How are you")// this is called as concatenation in javascript but this is old 
//now we use back ticks in js 

console.log(`hii ${name.toUpperCase()} hwo do you do ?${greeting}`);// this is new way of concatenation in javascript which is used mostly 
//here in the above you can use many thingsuppercase

const newName= new String("Abujojo");
console.log(newName[1]);// as it is only easy for you to access through an index
